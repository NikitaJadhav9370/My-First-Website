{Three ways to add CSS to the markup}

1) Inline CSS   : CSS is added to the directly using style attribute

2) Internal CSS : CSS is kept inside the haed tags in <style> tags

3) External CSS : CSS is kept separately inside a.css style sheet
                  Step ::
                  1) Write the CSS file in .css file
                  2) include that css file to that markup
